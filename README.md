# SALTE: Semi-Autonomous Linux Task Executor

SALTE aims to complete complex Linux tasks with minimal human intervention, leveraging the power of GPT-4 to generate detailed plans and execute them within the Linux command line environment.

## Core Principles

SALTE is built upon several foundational principles that guide its operation and development:

- **Autonomous Task Achievement**: Entrust SALTE with a broad task, and it will independently devise and implement a detailed plan to achieve it.

- **Intelligent Planning with GPT-4**: Utilizes the advanced capabilities of GPT-4 to generate step-by-step strategies tailored to the task at hand.

- **Ambiguity Resolution**: Features a dedicated "ambiguity" agent tasked with identifying uncertainties or decision points within plans, prompting human intervention when necessary.

- **Virtual World Definition**: SALTE operates within a "virtual world" — the Linux command line — understanding its capabilities, rules, and restrictions to effectively carry out tasks.

- **Contextual Awareness**: Maintains a text-based representation of the current state of the Linux environment, ensuring actions are relevant and informed.

- **Self-Reflection**: Employs self-assessment to verify the correct completion of each step, ensuring high-quality task execution.

- **Test-Driven Development**: Leverages GPT-4 to write unit tests prior to actual code development, emphasizing reliability and robustness from the outset.

- **Skill Library Expansion**: Continuously uses GPT-4 to enhance its skill library, dynamically developing new capabilities and code to tackle an expanding array of tasks.
